![thumbnail](https://github.com/XCRunnerS/BasePack-Minecraft189/blob/master/mc189thumb.png?raw=true)

## About

fyi, this is also downloaded and shown as `README.md` and can be opened in any text editor, ignore minor warnings on it!
put the `TUTORIAL-BASE pack.zip` file directly into your `.minecraft/resourcepacks` folder, then right-click, then click/select `extract here`

folder name = pack name
open folder, pack.mcmeta is a text doc to write the description - KEEP everything besides what is in the quotes!

pack.png is a png thumbnail of the pack, only files up to 64x will show all pixels properly on a 1080p monitor

### Directories

most of the textures you will mess with are in the following folders:

- `pack > assets > minecraft > textures > models > armor`
- `pack > assets > minecraft > textures > particle`
- `pack > assets > minecraft > textures > blocks`
- `pack > assets > minecraft > textures > items`
- `pack > assets > minecraft > textures > gui`

## Features

- sky files **(YOU WILL NEED TO USE A SKY TEMPLATE TO GET DECENT SKY IMAGES, THIS IS JUST THE FILES)**
- clear glass
- clear inventory
- short swords
- outlined ores
- low-fire
- hd font
- labeled color files
- small notes trail
- readme with resources (this file lol)
- credits.txt template and resources
- alternate textures for learning (located in subfolders called `NOTINUSE_{DESC}`) where {desc} is replaced with a short description

### `NOTINUSE` Folders

These folders are not meant to be put in the final packs, but are to help you learn more about what some parts of some textures do

### Alternatives

#### Other Base-Pack

#### Manual extraction of jar

you can also manually extract the jar of your version to use the 1.8.9 default textures, but you wont have some optifine files
locate your `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\versions\1.8.9`, and use a tool like [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or [Winrar](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) to extract the files. the assets folder will be your assets folder, just simply put it into a folder in your `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks` folder. You can also create `pack.png` and `pack.mcmeta` from scratch.
